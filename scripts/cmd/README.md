# Terminal Commands

These commands will (/can) be exposed via the `$/scripts/powershell/cmd.ps1` on the system path so these scripts can be run on the terminal.

# touch

`touch` is the linux command to create files, there are Windows alternatives e.g. `New-Item`, but as most of the community is on linux... makes it easier to follow demos.
