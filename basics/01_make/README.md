# 01 Make

A Makefile defines a set of tasks to be executed (sorta akin to the `scripts` section in a `package.json`);

## Steps

1. Go through the [installation](../INSTALL.md) process.
1. Run the hello world with;
   ```powershell
   make
   ```
1. Open up `Makefile` and change the echo to play around.
